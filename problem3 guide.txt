To replicate problem 1 and 2 with this program, do the following.

input.txt will have,
1 6
10
40
20
90
5
30

now, to do problem 1, do the following

COMPILE
gcc -o prob3 prob3.c -lm

RUN Fourier Analysis
./prob3 input.txt 0 output.txt

output.txt will have fourier coefficients.

RUN Fourier Synthesis
./prob3 output.txt 1 input.txt

input.txt will now have original numbers
